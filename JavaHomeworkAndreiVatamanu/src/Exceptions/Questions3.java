 /*What exception types can be caught by the following handler?
 catch (Exception e) {
  â€¦
 }
 What is wrong with using this type of exception handler?

Answer: This handler catches exceptions of type Exception; therefore, it catches any exception.
This can be a poor implementation because you are losing valuable information about the type of exception being thrown and making your code less efficient. 
As a result, your program may be forced to determine the type of exception before it can decide on the best recovery strategy.*/
